# excerpt: 'This study proposes a versatile framework for optimizing psychomotor learning through human motion analysis. Utilizing a wearable IMU sensor system, the motion trajectories of a given psychomotor task are acquired and then linked to points in a performance space using a predefined set of quality metrics specific to the psychomotor skill. This enables the identification of a benchmark cluster in the performance space, allowing correspondences to be established between the performance clusters and sets of trajectories in the motion space. As a result, common or specific deviations in the performance space can be identified, enabling remedial actions in the motion space to optimize performance. A thorough validation of the proposed framework is done in this paper using a Table Tennis forehand stroke as a case study. The resulting quantitative and visual representation of performance empowers individuals to optimize their skills and achieve peak performance.'
